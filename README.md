# AndroidArchitectureComponents
Sample application to demonstrate Android Architecture Components

# Why Acchitecture is important ??
- We want to produce 
  1. Maintainable: Maintainable software is a piece of software that has the ability
            
            - to fix a bug without introducing a new one,
            - to fix a bug without it reoccurring again and again,
            - to fix a bug with editing a low number of components.
            
  2. Extendable: Extendable software is a piece of software that has the ability
  
            - to add a new feature with a minimum change of current components  
            - to add a new feature without changing the shape of the original architecture.
            
  3. Testable: Testable software is a piece of software that has the ability 
  
            - to test each component separately that costs low-maintenance effort in order to improve or update our testing code.
